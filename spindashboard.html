        <!-- Overview -->
        <div class='contentblock first'>
            <h1>overview</h1>
            <p>For this project, my team was tasked with designing a data dashboard for spin employees to <b>account for the lack of a fast entry 
               point for data analysis</b> at the company. In our final design, we determined what information would be most important to our end 
               users and presented it through quickly comprehensible visualizations and seamless interactions. </p>
        </div>
        <!-- Problem -->
        <div class='contentblock'>
            <h1>problem</h1>
            <p>To better understand our end users and manage the scope of our project, we performed background research and centered our design 
               around the needs of two defined <b>personas</b>. Here is a quick overview of them:  </p>

            <h2>Kalen - Gig Worker</h2>
            <p><b>Kalen is a gig worker who travels around the city redistributing scooters to balance supply.</b> He also brings in scooters to charge 
                them and to do minor repairs between redistributions. He currently is working this job while he looks for another full-time position. 
                He is looking to maximize his ability to move scooters while also having enough downtime to <b>search for positions</b> while he is taking a 
                break. Also, repairing scooters gets him a bonus in his pay. He tries to <b>make the most of each gas tank.</b></p>

                <p class='horizontalitem'>“I usually take the popular Downtown-East Liberty route. This is normally the most efficient one, but that is 
                                           not always the case…”</p>
                <p class='horizontalitem'>“Often times when I drive, I found myself checking the Spin app and updating Google Maps accordingly…”</p>
                <p class='horizontalitem'>“I tend to eyeball the best time to take a break so I am constantly worried about missing the action…”</p>

            <h2>Mia - Data Analyst</h2>
            <p><b>Mia is data analyst at Spin Scooters.</b> She is tasked with understanding how well the scooter rollout in Pittsburgh is going. Her work will 
               help the company determine <b>where, when and how to increase or decrease scooter service in the city.</b> She was recently promoted based on her 
               data science acumen as well as her ability to tell stories with data. In here new role, she is <b>focusing more on connecting with the business 
               aspects rather than just data analysis.</b></p>

            <p>We began our design process by creating <b>current and future state models</b> for our two personas to plan out the needs our product would address and 
               the changes it would create. <br><br>

               We then each brainstormed different options for data visualizations and <b>wireframed</b> ways to present them with a dashboard. <br> <br>
                
               After receiving critique on our wireframes, we combined our ideas and proceeded to <b>design the full dashboard over multiple iterations.</b></p>

                    <h2>Route Planner</h2>
                    <p>By swiping right on a tab to the left of the map, Kalen can easily open up a route planner from his tablet. This interaction also keeps the planner 
                       unintrusive to Mia, who accesses the dashboard from her desktop.<br><br>
        
                       With the route planner, Kalen is presented the most efficient route for him to complete all his tasks, while still having the flexibility to edit

                    <p>In the past, Kalen had a hard time  to find the best time to take breaks while maintaining an efficient schedule. Now Kalen can easily identify 
                       the best time of the day to take break by glancing at a highlighted area of the time with lowest demand. </p>
